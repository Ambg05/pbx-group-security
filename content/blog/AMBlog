**Ann-Marie's blog from slides on GDPR**

The general thrust of the articles seem to endorse the approach of the Photobox Group to Security, particularly the following practices:
Assessing the fluid, evolving nature of cybersecurity
Understanding the importance of openness & sharing information to develop & adopt best practice 
Acknowledging that good security is about risk management spanning technology, people, and processes
The 2nd article, ‘Enemy at the gates’, considers the criteria that make a good 3rd party agreement, and gives a useful checklist for 3rd party agreements that should be compared to what Photobox has in place.
