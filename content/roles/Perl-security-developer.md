Photoboxâ€™s web software was built in 2007 and consists of over half a million lines of Perl. The code is extremely complex but also well-documented, and has proved itself over the past ten years of business.

- Learn about the Photobox web software -  both front-end and API systems and understand its strengths and weaknesses
- Rectify the most urgent security issues as directed by the security team
- Rectify performance and other issues that could lead to DOS attacks.
- Working with the security team, help to design and implement a security strategy for the web software in the medium to long term.
- Subject to availability, work on other tasks related to the web software as directed by the web team.
- Create documentation to support projects undertaken.
 
### Requirements:
 
The successful candidate should have the following skills:
 
- Expert knowledge of Perl 5 from current releases back to legacy editions.
- Expert knowledge of Apache/Perl/MySQL stacks and their implementation
- Expert knowledge of Amazon AWS
- Good working knowledge of Linux, Puppet, Git/Github, 
- [*** any formal security requirements? **]
